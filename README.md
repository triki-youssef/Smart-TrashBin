 
<h1>Smart TrashBin: Contactless Waste Disposal Using Arduino Nano & IR Sensor</h1>

<h2> 🔸 Description</h2>
The Smart TrashBin is a contactless, automated waste bin designed for hygiene and ease of use. Powered by an Arduino Nano, it uses an FC-51 infrared proximity sensor to detect motion or the presence of a hand near the lid. When triggered, a servo motor automatically opens the bin lid, waits for a few seconds, and then closes it — eliminating the need for physical contact. This system is ideal for homes, schools, offices, and public places where cleanliness is a top priority.

<h2> 🔹 Key Features:</h2>
